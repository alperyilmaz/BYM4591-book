There was a proud teak tree in the forest. He was tall and strong. There
was a small herb next to the tree. The teak tree said, “I am very
handsome and strong. No one can defeat me.” Hearing this, the herb
replied, “Dear friend, too much pride is harmful. Even the strong will
fall one day.” The teak ignored the herb’s words. He continued to praise
himself. A strong wind blew. The teak stood firmly. Even when it rained,
the teak stood strong by spreading its leaves. During these times, the
herb bowed low. The teak made fun of the herb. One day, there was a
storm in the forest. The herb bowed low. As usual, the teak did not want
to bow. The storm kept growing stronger. The teak could no longer bear
it. He felt his strength giving way. He tried his best to stand upright,
but in the end, he fell down. That was the end of the proud tree.When everything was calm again,
the herb stood straight.He looked around. He saw that the proud teak had fallen.

John and James were best friends. They fought for many reasons, but never gave up their friendship. They went in search of a job and visited many places to earn
some money. They passed through various places, villages, towns, forests, and beaches. They supported each other throughout their journey. One day, they reached
a desert. They had a very little food and water. John said that they should save the food and water for later use. However, James disagreed. He wanted to drink
water, as he was very thirsty. They quarrelled with each other for water. John slapped James, and they walked in silence. James wrote on the sand, “My best
friend slapped me!” Finally, they reached an oasis. They were very happy, and had a lot of fun in the water. While they both were bathing, James was a bit
careless and began to drown. John rushed to him and saved him. James hugged his friend and thanked him. They had a little nap and decided to leave the place.
When they were about to leave, James carved something on the rock. It was “My best friend saved my life!” He said to John, “When you slapped me, I recorded it
on sand. The wind would have blown it away by now. However, when you saved my life, I recorded it on rock. It will remain there forever.”
We have to forget the bad things and cherish the good things done to us.
